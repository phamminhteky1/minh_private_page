   <p>Minh was born on 12th of June, 2013. Since he was 4, he knew how to power his dad's computer on or off. At the summer of 2021, because he loves to play with LEGOs, his mom sent him to a robotic class, without knowing this is going to be an turning point of her son's life. At there, he get familar with progamming and engeneering. At level 4, he learns to progam the robots using Scratch. This intrests him and when he switched to learn Scratch, his teacher named his first account and now one of the 2 alts: phamminhteky1. Afterwards, he created 1 more account and now it's the main Scratch: phamminhteky1new. </p></body>
